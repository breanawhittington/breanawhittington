### Hello! I'm Breana (*bree-na*)


>##### I've spent my life in the world of numbers and data, and I know how important it is to see what's going on behind the scenes. It's my job to ensure that we have a solid understanding of our company's needs so that we can be sure we're providing the best possible service to clients. I am a detail-oriented and analytical individual with strong problem-solving skills and a passion for using data to drive decisions and improve processes. It's also essential for me to know how everything fits together so that I can help the team get things doneâ€”not just on my own, but together!
